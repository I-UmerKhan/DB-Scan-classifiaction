# ML-model-DBScan-classifiaction
I learned how to use DBSCAN clustering for classification. This density-based clustering method is useful because it identifies clusters of arbitrary shape by grouping together points that are closely packed, while marking points in low-density regions as outliers. DBSCAN is particularly effective for handling noisy datasets and discovering clusters without requiring a predefined number of clusters. This method is valuable for exploratory data analysis and can help reveal the natural structure of the data, making it easier to classify and understand complex datasets.
